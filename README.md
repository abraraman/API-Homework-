# API-Homework

## For this project, I took on the role of a FinTech consultancy firm that is aiming to make a difference by working on projects with high social impact in local communities. Having won a contract to help one of the biggest credit unions in my area, I was assigned with the task of creating a tool that would help their members enhance their financial health. In order to resolve this issue, I have created a prototype application (titled "Financial Planner.ipynb) consisting of two financial tools which allows the union's members to assess their monthly personal finances, and also be able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. 

## The first tool is a personal finance planner that allows users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

## The second tool is a retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.
